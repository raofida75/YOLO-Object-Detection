# YOLO-Object-Detection
YOLO, a real-time object detection algorithm, was presented in this paper. YOLO was well received because it ran in real- time without compromising on accuracy. The algorithm ‘only looks once’ at the image since it requires only a single forward propagation to detect objects. The YOLO algorithm employs a Convolutional Neural Network to predict class probabilities and multiple bounding boxes using image features. Traditional deep learning approaches for object detection, such as R-CNN and DPM, were typically too slow for real-time tasks. In this report, we will show how to use the most recent YOLOv4 algorithm for vehicle detection systems, which is one of the most important techniques used in self-driving cars.
